## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ¯ My objective is to create powerful, reliable, and dynamic products that spur innovation and corporate growth by utilizing my extensive technical knowledge and talents.

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tadiwa Lesley Musekiwa, a full-stack software engineer with a passion for building scalable web and mobile applications. I specialize in modern tech stacks like TypeScript, React, ASP.Net, GraphQL, and also work with advanced technologies such as ARM templates/Terraform, and Azure/AWS.

ðŸ’» My areas of experience include managing intricate data systems, creating APIs, and developing cloud architecture. Iâ€™m proficient in using Azure (Azure VMs, Azure Blob Storage, Azure functions, CosmosDB, CDK),Docker and Kubernetes to build robust, secure, and scalable infrastructures. On the backend, I work with Node.js, ASP.NET, and Springboot(Rest APIs) while my frontend experience covers React, React Native, Vuejs and Next.js.

ðŸ§  In addition to my professional work, Iâ€™ve built several applications integrating AI. One notable project is an AI-driven tool that helps teams plan the discovery phase of their projects, streamlining the process by gathering requirements and providing suggestions for technical architecture.

ðŸš€From refactoring intricate systems to designing AI-powered solutions, I prioritize writing clean, maintainable code. Iâ€™m also passionate about leveraging SonarCloud for code quality and EF Core for efficient database management.
